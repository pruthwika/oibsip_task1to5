**Task 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION**

Flower classification is a very important, simple, and basic project for any machine learning student. Every machine learning student should be thorough with the iris flowers dataset. 
This classification can be done by many classification algorithms in machine learning but in our article, we used logistic regression. Overall in this article, we have seen

Mainly we focused on Logistic Regression
We took Iris Flowers dataset and performed a logistic regression algorithm
Finally, it classified flowers into their species.
And we got an accuracy of 97.37%, which shows that the model we built is very accurate.

**Task 2-Unemployment analysis with python**

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. 
We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.
In this article, I will take you through the task of Unemployment analysis with Python.

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour.

**Task 3: Email spam detection with machine learning**

As collected data in order to train the model and predicted the category for new incoming emails. This indicate the importance of tagging the data in right way.
One mistake can make your machine dumb, e.g In your gmail or any other email account when you get the emails and you think it is a spam but you choose to ignore, may be next time when you see that email,
you should report that as a spam. This process can help a lot of other people who are receiving the same kind of email but not aware of what spam is.
Sometimes wrong spam tag can move a genuine email to spam folder too. So, you have to be careful before you tag an email as a spam or not spam.


**Task 4: Car price prediction
**
The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more.
Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if you want to learn how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you.

**Task 5: Sales prediction**

Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for,
or the platform you are advertising on about your product. Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate
the cost of advertising their product.
